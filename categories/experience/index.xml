a global, online summer internship program focused on introducing university students to bitcoin open-source development and design
When I started to write my proposal for it, there was only one week to go before the deadline. Luckily, my experience with OSS-Fuzz and my efforts paid off. I am proud to become one of the 83 students who will participate in Summer of Bitcoin 2022 and one of the 5 students to contribute to Bitcoin Core under the guidance of Marco Falke.</description></item></channel></rss>
