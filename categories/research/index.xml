However, most of the existing research focus on its theoretical security model, while ignoring the possible vulnerabilities in its software implementation. This paper will review how fuzzing, an increasingly popular automated vulnerability detection method, has been used in practice and refined stage by stage by Bitcoin Core developers. In addition, this paper will describe recent work published in ICSE 2022 that analyzes three different software testing techniques and summarizes their practical effects when applied to Bitcoin Core.</description></item></channel></rss>
