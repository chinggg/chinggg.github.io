However, most of the existing research focus on its theoretical security model, while ignoring the possible vulnerabilities in its software implementation. This paper will review how fuzzing, an increasingly popular automated vulnerability detection method, has been used in practice and refined stage by stage by Bitcoin Core developers. In addition, this paper will describe recent work published in ICSE 2022 that analyzes three different software testing techniques and summarizes their practical effects when applied to Bitcoin Core.</description></item><item><title>My Experience in Summer of Bitcoin 2022</title><link>https://chinggg.github.io/post/summer-of-bitcoin/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 21:20:48 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://chinggg.github.io/post/summer-of-bitcoin/</guid><description>What is Summer of Bitcoin?
a global, online summer internship program focused on introducing university students to bitcoin open-source development and design
When I started to write my proposal for it, there was only one week to go before the deadline. Luckily, my experience with OSS-Fuzz and my efforts paid off. I am proud to become one of the 83 students who will participate in Summer of Bitcoin 2022 and contribute to Bitcoin Core under the guidance of Marco Falke.</description></item></channel></rss>
