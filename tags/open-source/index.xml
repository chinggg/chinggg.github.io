I’m chinggg, a participant of GSoC 2022 with Qiling. For the past few months, I’ve been working on bridging Qiling with Radare2 (also known as r2) to enhance binary emulation with static analysis.
Motivation As a binary emulation framework, Qiling has done a nice job in emulation. But Qiling has limited ability to analyze binaries, users have to rely on other tools for useful information like function addresses then hardcode them, which is inconvenient.</description></item><item><title>My Summer of Bitcoin 2022 Experience</title><link>https://chinggg.github.io/post/summer-of-bitcoin/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 21:20:48 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://chinggg.github.io/post/summer-of-bitcoin/</guid><description>What is Summer of Bitcoin?
a global, online summer internship program focused on introducing university students to bitcoin open-source development and design
When I started to write my proposal for it, there was only one week to go before the deadline. Luckily, my experience with OSS-Fuzz and my efforts paid off. I am proud to become one of the 83 students who will participate in Summer of Bitcoin 2022 and one of the 5 students to contribute to Bitcoin Core under the guidance of Marco Falke.</description></item></channel></rss>
